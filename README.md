# News Site

The project was to build a classic magazine or newspaper site using grid or/and flexbox and making it responsive.

## The problem

To make the design to work well on different screens.
My choice was to use only Flexbox as I found it harder to understand and I needed the practice.
I used the inspector tool in the browser to  play with different properties and values. I also read a lot of code and googled different techniques.

I started up with a rough sketch but looking back I would rather have used a proper tool to use for the planning.
If I had more time I would have wotked on the design and styling.
